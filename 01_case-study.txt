QUESTION 
4. What strategies can you implement to 
ensure timely updates and maintenance of 
your software to adapt to changes in third-party 
software requirements?

ANSWER
I will try to use the strategies I learned in my
school days, One is Agile Approach, where we can
have Sprint Planning, Daily Stand-ups, Sprint Review,
and Retrospective. We can utilize this strategy to
ensure timely updates by having daily stand-up for
our daily updates, to know the current process,
plans, and problems encounter during that day or before
the daily stand-up. It can also be use to adapt
to changes by having Sprint review and Retrospective
to know what are the things you did, to know what went
well, and what went wrong. This is to know the things
you need to change for the next sprint to fullfill
the requirements.
